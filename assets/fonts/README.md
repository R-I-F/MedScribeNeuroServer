## Arabic Font Support

To enable Arabic text in PDF reports, download the Cairo font and place it here:

1. Download Cairo-Regular.ttf from: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cairo
2. Place the file as: `assets/fonts/Cairo-Regular.ttf`

The application will automatically detect and use this font for Arabic text rendering.
